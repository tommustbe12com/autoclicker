# autoclicker
Simple autoclicker for Windows. Made in AutoIt.

## OS version
Windows 10 and 11.

## How to use
Open the executable. Then, just click F3 to customize click settings. Those settings include which button to click and how fast to click. In this window you can also exit the script.

To start the autoclicker, click F1. To stop it, click F2.

It also runs in background taskbar. You can terminate it from there if needed.

## Limits
There are no technical limits but if you don't want your PC to blue screen or crash then keep the maximum click speed to 1ms. This is plenty fast, and going faster than this could result in a slow and laggy PC (no matter the specs it seems to me).

## Enjoy!
Simple autoclicker for Windows. Safe and easy to use.
